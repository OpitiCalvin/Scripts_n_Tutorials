    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is an introductory sorting algorithm that iterates through a list and compares pairings of adjacent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the sorting criteria, the algorithm swaps elements to shift elements towards the beginning or end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a list is sorted if for any element <code>e</code> and position <code>1</code> through <code>N</code>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>e1 <= e2 <= e3 ... eN</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of elements in the list.\n",

We want to combine them (to merge them) into a larger sorted list, let's call it <code>both</code>. To accomplish this we'll need to iterate through both with two indices, <code>left_index</code> and <code>right_index</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first <code>left_index</code> and <code>right_index</code> both point to the start of their respective lists. <code>left_index</code> points to the smallest element of <code>left</code> (its first element) and <code>right_index</code> points to the smallest element of <code>right</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the elements at <code>left_index</code> and <code>right_index</code>. The smaller of these two elements should be the first element of <code>both</code> because it's the smallest of both! It's the smallest of the two smallest values.\n",

    "## What Is A Radix\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick, which number is bigger: 1489012 or 54? Itâ€™s 1489012, but how can you tell? It has more digits so it has to be larger, but why exactly is that the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our number system was developed by 8th century Arabic mathematicians and was successful because it made arithmetic operations more sensible and larger numbers easier to write and comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakthrough those mathematicians made required defining a set of rules for how to depict every number. First we decide on an alphabet: different glyphs, or digits, that weâ€™ll use to write our numbers with. The alphabet that we use to depict numbers in this system are the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We call the length of this alphabet our radix (or base). So for our decimal system, we have a radix of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to understand what those digits mean in different positions. In our system we have a ones place, a tens place, a hundreds place and so on. So what do digits mean in each of those places?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where explaining gets a little complicated because the actual knowledge might feel very fundamental. Thereâ€™s a difference, for instance, between the digit '6' and the actual number six that we represent with the digit '6'. This difference is similar to the difference between the letter 'a' (which we can use in lots of words) and the word 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the core of the idea is that we use these digits to represent different values when they're used in different positions. The digit 6 in the number 26 represents the value 6, but the digit 6 used in the number 86452 represents the value 6000.\n",

    "## Base Numbering Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of different positions in a number increases by a multiplier of 10 in increasing positions. This means that a digit '8' in the rightmost place of a number is equal to the value 8, but that same digit when shifted left one position (i.e., in 80) is equal to <code>10 * 8</code>. If you shift it again one position you get 800, which is <code>10 * 10 * 8</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it's useful to incorporate the shorthand of exponential notation. It's important to note that 10<sup>0</sup> is equal to 1. Each position corresponds to a different exponent of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why 10? It's a consequence of how many digits are in our alphabet for numbering. Since we have 10 digits (0-9) we can count all the way up to 9 before we need to use a different position. This system that we used is called base-10 because of that.\n",

    "## Sorting By Radix\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does a radix sort use this base numbering system to sort integers? First, there are two different kinds of radix sort: most significant digit, or MSD, and least significant digit, or LSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both radix sorts organize the input list into ten \"buckets\", one for each digit. The numbers are placed into the buckets based on the MSD (left-most digit) or LSD (right-most digit). For example, the number 2367 would be placed into the bucket \"2\" for MSD and into \"7\" for LSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bucketing process is repeated over and over again until all digits in the longest number have been considered. The order within buckets for each iteration is preserved. For example, the numbers 23, 25 and 126 are placed in the \"3\", \"5\", and \"6\" buckets for an initial LSD bucketing. On the second iteration of the algorithm, they are all placed into the \"2\" bucket, but the order is preserved as 23, 25, 126.\n",

    "\n",
    "This makes its performance a little difficult to compare to most other comparison-based sorts. Consider a list of length <em>n</em>. For each iteration of the algorithm, we are deciding which bucket to place each of the <em>n</em> entries into.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many iterations do we have? Remember that we continue iterating until we examine each digit. This means we need to iterate for how ever many digits we have. We'll call this average number of digits the word-size or <em>w</em>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the complexity of radix sort is <code>O(wn)</code>. Assuming the length of the list is much larger than the number of digits, we can consider <em>n</em> a constant factor and this can be reduced to <code>O(n)</code>.\n",

    "1. Now that we've gotten our sort working let's test it out with some new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Run <code>radix_sort</code> on <code>unsorted_list</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What? <code>IndexError</code>? Did we forget something?\n",
    "\n",
    "    We did! Some of the numbers that we're sorting are going to be shorter than other numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can fix it though! First, we should comment out the line we added to test the sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Where we defined <code>digit</code> to be the value of <code>number_as_a_string</code> at index index we need to now wrap that definition in a <code>try</code> block.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a <code>try</code> block and, indented in that block, leave your original definition of digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the try block, we'll want to handle the possibility of an <code>IndexError</code>. What does it mean if we get an index error here?\n",
    "\n",
    "    It means the value for <code>number</code> at index is actually <code>0</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handle the exception by adding an <code>except IndexError</code> block, in this case assigning digit to be <code>0</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Excellent! Now let's try uncommenting the line where we sort <code>unordered_list</code>. Print out the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Great job! We created an algorithm that:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Takes numbers in an input list.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Passes through each digit in those numbers, from least to most significant.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Looks at the values of those digits.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Buckets the input list according to those digits.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Renders the results from that bucketing.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Repeats this process until the list is sorted.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "    And that's what a radix sort does! Feel free to play around with the solution code, see if there's anything you can improve about the code or a different way of writing it you want to try.\n"
