    "Folium uses the Jinja2 Python template engine to render the final results and Pandas to bind the CSV statistic data. The code begins with importing and then defining the data sources. The GeoJSON file of the U.S. State polygons will be displayed as a chloropleth map. A choropleth map is one that displays data values that are classified into a defined set of data ranges, usually based on some statistical method. Within the GeoJSON data is a key-filed named id with a value the U.S. State abbreviation code. This id binds the spatial data to the statistic CSV column that also includes a corresponding id field, hence allowing us to connect our two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium then needs to create a map object, setting the map center coordinates alongside a zoom level and a base tile map for our background. In our case, the Stamen Toner tile set is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we define the vector GeoJSON that is going to appear on top of our background map. We need to pass in the path of our source GeoJSON and the Pandas data frame object that references our CSV file columns, State and Unemployment. Next, we set the linking key value that connects our CSV with the GeoJSON data. The key_on parameter reads the id GeoJSON properties key in the feature array.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main methodology for draping an orthophoto is the same as seen in the previous section, with a slight difference in the way we use the Three.js material rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation plays the biggest and most important role once again to make things jive together. Inside our Python code, Ch10-04_drapeOrtho.py uses the subprocess call to execute the gdalwarp and gdal_translate command-line tools. Gdalwarp is first used by taking the original orthophoto in EPSG:3157 and converting it to the EPSG:3857 Web Mercator format. At the same time, it also cuts the original raster to the same extent as our DEM input. This extent is achieved by reading the gdalinfo whistler.bin raster command-line call.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we need to cut the raster down to size and make a 200 x 200 pixel image to match our DEM size. This is followed by using PIL to transform the output .tif file into a much smaller .jpg file that's better suited for web presentations and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the major leg work out of the way, we can use Jinja2 to create our output HTML template and pass in two dem_file, variables pointing to the original DEM. The second variable called texture_map points to the newly created whistler .jpg that's used to drape over the DEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final results are written to the /ch10/www/html/ch10-04_dem3d_map_drape.html folder for you to then open and view in the browser. To view this HTML file, you will need to start a local web server from the /ch10/www/ directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>> python -m simpleHTTPServer 8080</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, visit the browser at http://localhost.8080/ and you should see a draped image on the DEM."
