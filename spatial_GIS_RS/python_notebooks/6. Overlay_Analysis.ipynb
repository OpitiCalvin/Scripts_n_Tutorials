    "Discovering how two datasets spatially relate to each other when they are placed over one another is called overlay analysis. An overlay can be compared to a sheet of tracing paper. For example, you could overlay the tracing paper on top of your base map and see what areas overlap each other. This process is and was a game changer in spatial analysis and modeling. Computer-aided GIS computations can therefor automatically identify where two geometry sets spatially touch for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this chapter is to give you a feel for the most common overlay analysis functions, such as unions, intersects, and symmetrical differences. These are based on the Dimensionally Extended nine intersection model (DE-9IM), which can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM, and describes our list of possible overlays. All processes that we use or name here are derived using a combination of these nine predicates.\n",

    "## 6.1. Punching holes in polygons with a symmetric difference operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, oh why would we want to punch holes in polygons and create a donut? Well, this is done for several reasons, for example, you may want to remove a lake polygon from a forest polygon that it overlaps since it sits in the middle of the forest and is, therefore, included in your area calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is where we have a set of polygons representing a golf course's fairways and a second set of polygons representing the greens that overlap these fairways. Our task is to calculate the correct number of square meters of fairways. The greens will create our donuts in a fairway's polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is translated into spatial operation terminology and means that we need to perform a symmetric difference operation or, in ESRI terminology, an \"erase\" operation.\n",

The transformation process is not covered here; take a look at Chapter 2, Working with Projections, for further information on how to transform data between two coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to read in both the GeoJSON files into Python dictionaries objects using the standard Python json module. Next, we set up some empty lists that will store the Shapely geometry objects as a list used for our input to generate the needed MultiPolygons for our analysis. We use the Shapely built-in asShape() function to create the Shapely geometry objects so that we can perform the spatial operations. This is accomplished by accessing the dictionaries' ['geometry'] element. We then append each geometry to our empty list. This list is then inputted into the Shapely MultiPolygon() function that will create a MultiPolygon for us and is used as our inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual process of running our symmetric_difference happens when we input the fairways_plys MultiPolygon as input and the parameter passed is the greens_ply MultiPolygon. The output is stored in the result variable, which itself is also a MultiPolygon. Not to forget, a MultiPolygon is just a list of polygons that we can iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we'll take a look at a function called write_wkt(filepath, features). This outputs our resulting MultiPolygon Shapely geometry to the Well Known Text (WKT) format. We do not simply output this WKT but instead, create a new JavaScript file, ol3/data/ch06-01_results_sym_diff.js, containing our WKT output. The code outputs a string that creates a JavaScript variable called ply_data. This ply_data variable is then used in our HTML file located at /ch06/code/ol3/html/sym_diff.html to draw our WKT vector layer using Openlayers 3. We then call our function and it executes the write to the WKT JavaScript file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is the first that visualizes our results as a web map. In Chapter 11, Web Analysis with GeoDjango, we will explore a fully functional web mapping application; for those of you who cannot wait, you may want to jump ahead. Further examples will continue to use Openlayers 3 as our data viewer, moving away from using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, our simple one-line symmetric difference execution needed a lot of helper code to deal with importing GeoJSON data and exporting the results in a format that could display a web map with Openlayers 3."

    "### How it works...\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick high-level run-through of what is going on here at the beginning should help clear the air. We have four functions and nine variables within our Python code to split the load of input and output data. The running of our code takes place in the if __name__ == \"main\": call that is found at the end of the code. We start defining two variables to deal with our inputs that we are going to union together. These two are our input Shapefiles and the other three outputs are GeoJSON and JavaScript files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The create_shapes()function converts our Shapefile into Shapely MultiPolygon geometry objects. Inside the Python class, the list comprehension is used to generate a new list of polygon objects, which are the input list of polygons used to create our output MultiPolygon. Next, we'll simply run this function passing in our input Shapefiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our create_union() function is up next where we do the real union work. We begin by unioning the two geometry boundaries together that produces a union set of LineStrings and represents the outer bounds of our input polygons. The reason for this is that we do not want to lose the geometries of both polygons, which will, by default, dissolve into one big polygon when simply passed into the Shapely union function. Therefore, we need to rebuild the polygons with the polygonize() Shapely function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The polygonize function creates a Python generator object, not a simple geometry. This is an iterator that's similar to a list that we need to loop over to get at the individual polygons it's created for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do exactly this in the next code segment using the enumerate() Python function that automatically creates an ID for us for each feature that we use as the id field in the attribute results. After our loop, we use the standard Python json.dump() method to export our newly created GeoJSON file and write it to disk using the Python open() method in the write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in our create_union() function, we prepare to output our resulting union polygon as a Shapely MultiPolygon object. This is accomplished simply by looping through the polygonize() iterator and outputting a list that feeds into the Shapely MultiPolygon()function. Finally, we execute the union function, passing in our two input geometries and specifying the output GeoJSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can view our results in our web map as we did in the previous exercise using a small function called write_wkt(). This little function takes the file path to the output JavaScript file that we want to create and the MultiPolygon result's geometry. Shapely then dumps the geometry into the Well Known Text format as we write it out to the JavaScript file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, a small function called output_geojson_fc() is used to output another GeoJSON file, this time using the Python geojson library. This simply shows you another way to recreate a GeoJSON file. Since GeoJSON is a plain text file, it is possible to create it in many unique ways depending on your personal programming preference."

As you see in the imports, we use three functions for the standard input and output of data. The main application starts with defining our NOAA input Shapefile and defining the output GeoJSON file. Then, if we run the code, it will crash due to data validity issues. So, we create a new function to check our input data for invalid geometries. This new function will catch these invalid geometries and convert them to valid polygons.\n",

    "\n",

Our resulting MultiPolygons are pushed further into our out_geoj() function, which finally writes the new geometries to disk in our /ch06/geodata folder."
