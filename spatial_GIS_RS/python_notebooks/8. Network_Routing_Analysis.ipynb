    "## 8.1. Finding the Dijkstra shortest path with pgRouting\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few Python libraries out there, such as networkX and scikit-image, that can find the shortest path over a raster or NumPy array. We want to focus on routing over a vector source and returning a vector dataset; therefore, pgRouting is a natural choice for us. Custom Python Dijkstra or the A Star (A*) shortest path algorithms exist but one that performs well on large networks is hard to find. The pgRouting extension of PostgreSQL is used by OSM and many other projects and is well tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example will have us load a Shapefile of an indoor network from one floor for simplicity's sake. An indoor network is comprised of network lines that go along the hallways and open walkable spaces within a building, leading to a door in most cases.\n",
    "Getting ready\n",
    "\n",
    "For this recipe, we are going to need to set up our PostGIS database with the pgRouting extension. On a Windows machine, you can install pgRouting by downloading a ZIP file for Postgresql 9.3 at http://winnie.postgis.net/download/windows/pg93/buildbot/. Then, extract the zip file into C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.3\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Ubuntu Linux users, the pgRouting website explains the details at http://docs.pgrouting.org/2.0/en/doc/src/installation/index.html#ubuntu-debian.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this extension, you have a couple of options. First off, you can run the command-line psql tool to activate the extension as follows if you have your PostgreSQL running as explained in Chapter 1, Setting Up Your Geospatial Python Environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "> psql py_geoan_cb -c \"create extension pgrouting\"\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the pgAdmin user tool by simply opening up the py_geoan_cb database, right-clicking on Extensions, selecting New Extension..., and in the Name field, scrolling down to find the pgRouting entry and selecting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need some data to do our routing calculations. The data used is a Shapefile located in your /ch08/geodata/shp/e01_network_lines_3857.shp folder. Take a look at Chapter 3, Moving Spatial Data from One Format to Another, on how to import the Shapefile or use shp2pgsql. Here is the command-line one-liner using ogr2ogr to import the Shapefile:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    ">ogr2ogr -a_srs EPSG:3857 -lco \"SCHEMA=geodata\" -lco \"COLUMN_TYPES=type=varchar,type_id=integer\" -nlt MULTILINESTRING -nln ch08_e01_networklines -f PostgreSQL \"PG:host=localhost port=5432 user=pluto dbname=py_geoan_cb password=secret\" geodata/shp/e01_network_lines_3857.shp\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you either use the same username and password from Chapter 1, Setting Up Your Geospatial Python Environment, or your own defined username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, you might need to insert the full path of your Shapefile, something that could look like c:\\somepath\\geodata\\shp\\e01_network_lines.shp. We explicitly set the input of the EPSG:3857 Web Mercator because, sometimes, ogr2ogr guesses the wrong projection and in this way, it ensures that it is correct on upload. Another thing to note is that we also explicitly define the output table column types because ogr2ogr uses numeric fields for our integers and this does not go well with pgRouting, so we explicitly pass the comma-separated list of field names and field types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><strong>Tip</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed description of how ogr2ogr works, visit http://gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html. </pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new table includes two fields, one called type and the other, type_id. The type_id variable will store an integer used to identify what kind of network segment we are on, such as stairs, an indoor way, or elevator. The remaining fields are necessary for pgRouting, which is installed as shown in the following code, and include columns called source, target, and cost. The source and target columns both need to be integers, while the cost field is of a double precision type. These types are the requirements of the pgRouting functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and add these fields now to our ch08_e01_networklines table with the help of some SQL queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "ALTER TABLE geodata.ch08_e01_networklines ADD COLUMN source INTEGER;\n",
    "ALTER TABLE geodata.ch08_e01_networklines ADD COLUMN target INTEGER;\n",
    "ALTER TABLE geodata.ch08_e01_networklines ADD COLUMN cost DOUBLE PRECISION;\n",
    "ALTER TABLE geodata.ch08_e01_networklines ADD COLUMN length DOUBLE PRECISION;\n",
    "UPDATE geodata.ch08_e01_networklines set length = ST_Length(wkb_geometry);\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the network dataset has its new columns, we need to run the create topology pgr_createTopology()function. This function takes the name of our network dataset, a tolerance value, geometry field name, and a primary key field name. The function will create a new table of points on the LineString intersections, that is, nodes on a network that are in the same schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "SELECT public.pgr_createTopology('geodata.ch08_e01_networklines',\n",
    "        0.0001, 'wkb_geometry', 'ogc_fid');\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The pgr_createTopology function parameters include the name of the networklines LineStrings containing our cost and type fields. The second parameter is the distance tolerance in meters followed by the name of the geometry column and our primary key unique id called ogc_fid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our tables and environment are set up, this allows us to actually create the shortest path called the Dijkstra route.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Python code, make sure you have the psycopg2 and geojson modules installed as described in Chapter 1, Setting Up Your Geospatial Python Environment."

The natural way to do this is to input and the x, y coordinate pair for the start and end points. Unfortunately, the pgr_dijkstra() function takes only the start and end node IDs. This means that we need to get these node IDs from the new table called ch08_e01_networklines_vertices_pgr. To locate the nodes, we use a simple PostGIS function, ST_Within(), to find the nearest node within one meter from the input coordinate. Inside this query, our input geometry uses the ST_GeomFromText() function so that you can clearly see where things go in our SQL. Now, we'll execute our query and convert the response to an integer value as our node ID. This node ID is then ready for input in the next and final query.\n",

This query performs a JOIN between the generated route IDs and input network IDs so that we have some geometry output to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our journey then ends with processing the results and creating our output GeoJSON file. The routing query has returned a list of individual segments from start to end that aren't in the form of a single LineString, but a set of many LineStrings. This is why we need to create a list and append each route segment to a list by creating our GeoJSON FeatureCollection file.\n",

    "### How it works...\n",
    "\n",
    "The code starts with database boiler plate code plus a function to export the GeoJSON result files. To create an evacuation polygon, we require one input, which is the starting point for the distance calculation polygon on our network. As seen in the previous section, we need to find the node on the network closest to our starting coordinate. Therefore, we run a SQL select to find this node that's within one meter of our coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we define the combined_result variable that will hold all the points reachable for all specified evacuation times in our list. Hence, it stores the results of each evacuation time in one single output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hallways Shapefile is then prepared as Shapely geometry because we will need it to clip our output polygons to be inside the hallways. We are only interested in seeing which areas can be evacuated within the specified time scales of 10, 20, 30, and 60 seconds. If the area is outside the hallways, you are located outside the building and, well, better said, you are safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will loop through each of our time intervals to create individual evacuation polygons for each time defined in our list. The pgRouting extension includes a function called pgr_drivingDistance(), which returns a list of nodes that are reachable within a specified cost. Parameters for this function include the SQL query that returns id, source, target, and cost columns. Our final four parameters include the start node ID that's represented by the %s variable and equals start_node_id. Then, the evacuation time in seconds stored within the evac_time variable followed by two false values. These last two false values are for the directed route or reverse cost calculation, which we are not using.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><strong>Note</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the cost is calculated as a time value in seconds based on distance. We assume that you are walking at 5 km/hr. The cost is then calculated as the segment length in meters divided by 5000 m x 60 min x 60 sec to derive a cost value. Then, we pass in the start node ID along with our specified evacuation time in seconds. If you want to calculate in minutes, simply remove one of the x 60 in the equation.</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of each node is then derived through a SQL JOIN between the vertices table and the result list of nodes with node IDs. Now that we have our set of geometry of points for each node reachable within our evacuation time, it's time to parse this result. Parsing is required to create our GeoJSON output, and it also feeds the points into our combined output, the combined_result variable, and the individual evacuation time polygons that are created with a convex hull algorithm from Shapely.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><strong>Tip</strong>\n",
    "A better or more realistic polygon could be created using alpha shapes. Alpha shapes form a polygon from a set of points, hugging each point to retain a more realistic polygon that follow the shape of the points. The convex hull simply ensures that all the points are inside the resulting polygon. For a good read on alpha shapes, check out this post by Sean Gillies at http://sgillies.net/blog/1155/the-fading-shape-of-alpha/ and this post at http://blog.thehumangeo.com/2014/05/12/drawing-boundaries-in-python/.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is included in the code is the alpha shapes module called //ch08/code/alpha_shape.py that you can try out with the input data points created, if you've followed along so far, to create a more accurate polygon.</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our route_results variable stores the GeoJSON geometry used to create individual convex hull polygons. This variable is then used to populate the list of points for each evacuation set of points. It also provides the source of our GeoJSON export, creating FeatureCollection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final calculations include using Shapely to create the convex hull polygon, immediately followed by intersecting this new convex hull polygon with our input Shapefile that represents the building hallways. We are only interested in showing areas to evacuate, which boils down to only areas inside the building, hence the intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining code exports our results to the GeoJSON files in your /ch08/geodata folder. Go ahead and open this folder and drag and drop the GeoJSON files into QGIS to visualize your new results. You will want to grab the following files:\n",

    "Starting with centerlines.py that contains the Centerline class, there is a lot going on inside the class. We use the Voronoi polygons and extract ridges as centerlines. To create these Voronoi polygons, we need to convert our polygon into LineStrings representing inner and outer polygon edges. These edges then need to be converted to points to feed the Voronoi algorithm. The points are generated based on a densify algorithm that creates points every 0.5 m along the edge of a polygon and all the way around it. This helps the Voronoi function create a more accurate representation of the polygon, and hence provides a better centerline. On the negative side, the higher this distance is set, the more computing power needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ch08-04_centerline.py code then imports this new Centerline class and actually runs it using our hallways polygon. The input polygons are read from a Shapefile using pyshp. Our generated shapes are then pumped into the generate_centerlines function to output a dictionary of LineStrings representing our centerlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "That output dictionary is then exported to GeoJSON as we loop over the centerlines and use the standard json.dumps function to export it to our file."

This is, of course, the most complex situation involving complex data collection, preparation, and implementation processes. We cannot go into all the complex data details of collection and transformation from ACAD to PostGIS, for example; instead, the finished data is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an indoor routing application, you need an already digitized routing network set of lines representing the areas where people can walk. Our data represents the first and second floor of a university building. The resulting indoor route, shown in the following screenshot, starts from the second floor and travels down the stairs to the first floor, all the way through the building, heading up the stairs again to the second floor, and finally reaching our destination.\n",

    "    <li>Python modules, psycopg2 and geojson.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the list of tasks that we need to carry out:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.     Import the Shapefile of the first floor networklines (skip this if you've completed the earlier recipe that imported this Shapefile) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>ogr2ogr -a_srs EPSG:3857 -lco \"SCHEMA=geodata\" -lco \"COLUMN_TYPES=type=varchar,type_id=integer\" -nlt MULTILINESTRING -nln ch08_e01_networklines -f PostgreSQL \"PG:host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres dbname=py_geoan_cb password=air\" geodata/shp/e01_network_lines_3857.shp</code>\n",

    "Using the psycopg2 module, we can connect to our fancy new tables in the database and run some queries. The first query set finds the start and end nodes based on the x, y, and Z elevation values. The Z value is VERY important; otherwise, the wrong node will be selected. The Z value corresponds one to one with a layer/floor value. The 3D elevation data assigned to our networklines_3857 dataset is simply one meter for floor one and two meters for floor two. This keeps things simple and easy to remember without actually using the real height of the floors, which, of course, you could do if you want to.\n",
