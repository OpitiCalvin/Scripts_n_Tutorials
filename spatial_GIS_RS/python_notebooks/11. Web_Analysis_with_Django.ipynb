    "\n",
    "Let's now create a Django project using the django-admin tool as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the command line, enter the <em>/ch11/code</em> directory and execute this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>$ django-admin startproject web_analysis</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now you will have a <em>/ch11/code/web_analysis/web_analysis<em> directory and inside it, you'll find all the standard basic Django components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To create our web service, we are going to place all the services into a Django App called <em>api</em>. This app will store all our services. Creating this <em>api</em> application is as easy as typing this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $  cd web_analysis </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Change into the newly created <em>web_analysis</em> directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ django-admin startapp api </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create your new application called \"api\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. This creates a new <em>/ch11/code/web_analysis/api</em> folder and inside it you will find the default installed Django app files. Next, we need to tell Django about the Django REST Framework, GeoDjango gis app, and our new api application; we do this in our <em>/ch11/code/web_analysis/web_analysis/settings.py</em> file. Let's add the lines <em>'django.contrib.gis', 'rest_framework'</em>, and <em>'api'</em> to our <em>INSTALLED_APPS</em> variable as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n",
    "        'django.contrib.admin',\n",

We have it commented out at this point since we are not going to use it until later, but feel free to uncomment it as this will do no harm. This spatial framework requires a spatial database and we will use PostgreSQL with PostGIS as our backend. Let's go ahead and change the database connection now in our <em>settings.py</em> as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",

    "\n",
    "9. With this new schema in place, we only need to assign the PostgreSQL <em>search_path</em> variable order to set the <em>django</em> schema as the first priority. To accomplish this, we need to use the SQL <em>ALTER ROLE</em> command as follows:\n",

    "<code>ALTER ROLE saturn SET search_path = django, geodata, public, topology; </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. This sets the <em>search_path</em> order defining <em>django</em> as the first schema, <em>geodata</em> as the second, and so forth.

    "### How it works...\n",
    "Our view handles the request and response using the Django REST Framework. There are two functions that do all the hard work without ever using the Django Object Relational Mapper (ORM). The reason for this is two-fold: first, to show you the basics of direct Database usage without too much abstraction and the inner workings of what is going on; second, because we are using functions of PostGIS that are not available directly through the ORM of GeoDjango, such as ST_3DDistance or ST_PointFromText. We could use some of the fancy Django helpers, such as .extra(), but this would confuse everyone but an experienced Django user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss the first find_closest_network_node function that takes three parameters: x_coord, y_coord, and floor. The x and y coordinates should be double precision float values, while the floor is an integer. Our regular expression URL limits any request to digits so there is no need to do any extra format checking in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL query that finds the nearest node and returns its ID limits the search radius to 200 m, which would equal one huge room or auditorium. Then, we order by the 3D distance between the points and LIMIT the result to one since we are not routing to multiple locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feeds our second function called create_route where we pass it the start coordinate, start floor integer, end coordinate, and end floor number. Our URL at /web_analysis/api/urls.py uses a regular expression named groups that corresponds to the same names used in the request parameters of our function. This keeps things more explicit so that you know what values belong where in a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with parsing the incoming parameters to get the exact values as floats and integers to feed our routing query. The routing query itself is unchanged from Chapter 8, Network Routing Analysis, so refer to this chapter for more details. The Django REST framework response sends the GeoJSON back to the client and has the ability to return it as raw text as well."

    "### Getting ready\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to access some more data on our network to allow routing types. The type of route is based on a network line type, which is stored as an attribute on each LineString. To classify our route types, we have the following lookup table schema:\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>Value</th>\n",
    "        <th>Route Type</th>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>0</td>\n",
    "        <td>Indoor route</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>1</td>\n",
    "        <td>Outdoor route</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>2</td>\n",
    "        <td>Elevator</td>\n",

    "        <td>3</td>\n",
    "        <td>Stairs</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we want to avoid any stairs segments, which technically means avoiding <em>type_id = 3</em>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Note</strong>\n",
    "Optionally, you could create a lookup table to store all the possible types and their equivalent weights. These values could then be included in the calculation of the total cost value to influence the route outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can control how the route is generated based on certain preferences as well. A standard route search can now be set for preferences, such as taking the stairs over the elevator or vice versa, depending on your needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "ALTER TABLE geodata.ch08_e01_networklines ADD COLUMN total_cost double precision;\n",

    "### How to do it...\n",
    "\n",
    "The least-cost path from any point is controlled by a basic property called cost. For a standard route, the cost is equal to the distance of a segment. We search for the least-cost path, which means finding the shortest path to our destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the path, we set the cost values. Creating a barrier-free route involves setting all segment types equal to stairs at an extraordinarily high value so that the path, that is, the distance, is huge and is, therefore, excluded in the shortest path route finding process. Our other option is to add a WHERE clause to the query and only accept values where type_id is not equal to 3, which means that it is not of the type stairs. We are going to use this option in our upcoming code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore our data needs to be clean in order to allow us to assign specific costs to specific segment types in our network lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to add a new parameter to capture the route type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll update the /api/views.py function, create route(), and add a new parameter called route_type. Next up is the actual query that needs to accept this new parameter. We set up a new variable called barrierfree_q to hold the WHERE clause that we will add to our original query:\n",

    "\n",
    "The frontend needs the user to select a route type with the default route type set to a standard value, such as 0, as in the case of stairs. This default type is used because in most indoor environments the stairs are usually shorter. You can, of course, change this default to whatever value or criteria you'd like at any time. A radio select box is used to restrain the choice to either a standard route or a barrier-free route. Upon selecting a route type, the map automatically removes the old route and creates a new route."

    "### How it works...\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal workings of each step are shown, so let's go through all of them one at a time. We start off with the data import of our new room dataset as the basic starting and ending points of our new indoor routing tool. We lay out the top-level structure of our API with some new URLs, defining how we will call the new routing service, and then define these variables. Our regular expressions handle the correct data types that are passed in the URL without any exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These URL patterns are then used by api/views.py to actually accept the incoming room numbers and route types to generate our new route. This generation is split up into a few functions to increase usability. The get_room_centroid_node() function is necessary so that we can find the middle point of the room and then find the next nearest node on a network. We could also simply use the polygon geometry to find the nearest node but this can lead to ambiguity if the rooms are large and the entrances are close to each other. The centroid method is much more reliable and does not add too much overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The run_route() function actually then runs find_closest_network_node(), which we created earlier, making things work well together. The run_route function then generates our GeoJSON result as it is passed in the start node ID, end node ID, and the route type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The route_room_to_room() function is small as the heavy lifting has already been completed by our other functions. It simply inputs the URL parameters called by our API call, as seen in http://localhost:8000/api/directions/10010&20043&0. The final steps after step 6 are for the user interface. We need to provide the user with a list of rooms that are available to route from and to. The /api/rooms URL provides exactly this, delivering a JSON array of room numbers. The input fields are bootstrap inputs with Twitter Typeahead.js and Bloodhound.js to prefetch remote data. As a user, you simply enter a number and, bingo, a list appears. More detailed instructions on the JavaScript side of things are a little beyond the scope of this book, but these are, thankfully, kept to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, you now have a fully functional indoor mapping web application with a basic set of indoor 3D routing functions that you can expand on at any time."
