    "## 9.1. Creating a rule – only one point inside a polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "A long time ago in GIS history, not having more than one point present in a polygon was super important because one point per polygon was the standard way to demonstrate a topologically clean polygon with its associated attribute and ID. Today, it is still important for many other reasons, such as assigning attributes to polygons based on points inside a polygon. We must perform a spatial join between the polygon and point to assign these valuable attributes. If two points are located in one polygon, which attributes do you use? This recipe is about creating a rule to check your data beforehand to ensure that only one point is located in each polygon. If this test fails, you will get a list or errors; if it passes, the test returns True.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have lots of things to test to determine whether there's only one point inside the polygon. We'll start with what is defined as inside and not inside. Looking back at the introduction to this chapter, a polygon interior, exterior, and boundary can be logically defined. The position of our input points is then explicitly defined as a point that lies within a polygon, excluding points that are located on the polygon boundary, edge, or vertex. Plus, our added criterion is that only one point per polygon is allowed, thus giving errors if 0 or more points fall inside any given polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our spatial predicates include touches to find out whether the point is on the vertex or edge. If touches returns True, our point is located on the edge or vertex, which means that it is not inside. This is followed by the contains method that checks whether the point is inside our polygon. Here, we check to see that there's no more than one point inside our polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code works through importing and converting a Shapefile for processing performed by the Shapely module. As we process our polygons, we create a couple of lists to track what kind of relationship is found between them so that we can sum them up at the end, allowing us to count if zero or more than one point is inside a single polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our last bit of code then runs through a series of simple function calls, testing out the several scenarios relative to whether a point is inside the polygon or not. The final call runs through the Shapefiles with multiple polygons and points in a more realistic test. This then returns either True if no errors are found or it returns a GeoJSON printout, showing you where the errors are located."
