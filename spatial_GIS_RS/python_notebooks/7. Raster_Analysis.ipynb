    "Raster analysis works similar to vector analysis but the spatial relation is determined by the position of the raster cell. Most of our raster data is collected through diverse remote sensing techniques. In this chapter, the goals are quite simple and focused on working with and around a digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM we are using is from Whistler, BC, Canada, home to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Our DEM is in the form of the USGS ASCII CDED (.dem) format. The DEM is our source data that is used to derive several new raster datasets. As with other chapters, we will leverage Python as our glue to run scripts to enable a processing pipeline for raster data. The visualization of our data will play out with matplotlib along with the QGIS desktop GIS."

    "Importing and working with a DEM in PostGIS is what this recipe is all about. We begin our journey with a text file that's full of points and is stored in the USGS ASCII CDED format (to read more about the details of this format, feel free to look at the documentation page at http://www.gdal.org/frmt_usgsdem.html). The ASCII format is well known and accepted by many desktop GIS applications as a direct data source. Feel free to simply open up your ASCII file with QGIS to view the files and see the resulting raster representation that it creates for you. Our task at hand is to import this DEM file into a PostGIS database, creating a new PostGIS raster dataset within PostGIS We perform this task by using a command-line tool called raster2pgsql, which is installed along with your PostGIS installation. The raster2pgsql tool is located on Windows under C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.3\\bin\\ if you are running PostgreSQL 9.\n",

The shell=True argument comes with a big warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all goes well, no exceptions should pop up, but if they do, we catch them using the standard Python try statement.\n",

    "There are two functions that are used to create our elevation profile. The first get_elevation()function returns a single elevation value per pixel for each band in a raster. This means that our input raster can contain multiple bands of data. Our second function will write our results to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The get_elevation() function creates a list of elevation values; to achieve this, we need to extract some details from our input elevation raster. The x and y origin coordinates are used in combination with the raster pixel width and height to help find pixels in our raster. This information is then processed with our input x and y coordinates where we want the elevation value to be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we loop through all the available bands in our raster and find the elevation value per band that's located at coordinates x and y from our input. The ReadAsArray GDAL function finds this location, and then all we need to do is get the first object of the second nested list array. This value is then appended to a new list of elevation values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process our data, we define the input paths of our raster with the os.path.realpath() Python function that returns the full path to our input. GDAL is used to open our DEM raster and return the number of bands plus the x origin, y origin, pixel width, and pixel height information from our raster. This is located in the transform variable that's passed into our get_elevation() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working our way further, we define our input LineString. This LineString defines where the cross-section profile is going to be extracted. To process our data, we want to extract elevation values every 20 m along our input LineString. This is done in the for loop as we specify the range based on the LineString length and our input of 20 m. Using the Shapely Interpolate linear referencing function, we then create a point object every 20 m. These values are then stored in separate x, y, and z lists, which are then updated. The z list contains our list of new elevation points. Individual elevations are collected by specifying the first object in the list that's returned by our get_elevation() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put all this together in a CSV file, we use the Python zip function to combine the distance values with the elevation values. This creates the final two columns of data, showing us the distance from the starting point of our LineString on the x-axis and the elevation value on the y-axis.\n",
