    "Vector data analysis is used in many, many application areas, starting from measuring the distance from point A to point B all the way through to complex routing algorithms. The first GIS systems were built on vector data and vector analysis, and then later expanded into the raster domain. In this chapter, we will start with simple vector operations, then work our way into a more complex model, chaining the various vector methods together to deliver new data that answers our spatial questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of data analysis is broken down into a couple of steps starting with an input dataset, performing a spatial operation on the data such as a buffer analysis, and, finally, we'll have some output in the form of a new dataset. The following diagram shows the flow of analysis in the simplest model form:\n",

    "Converting simple questions into spatial operation methods and models takes experience and is not a simple task. For example, you may come across a simple task such as, \"Identify and locate how many residential land parcels were affected by the flood.\" This would translate into the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Firstly, an input dataset in the form of a flood polygon that defines the affected floods areas</li>\n",
    "    <li>Secondly, the input dataset represents cadaster polygons</li>\n",

    "    <li>All of this results in a new polygon dataset</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "A project involving spatial data is typically geographically limited to within a specified boundary area, the so-called project area. The input data can come from multiple sources and usually extends outside the project area. Removing this excess data is sometimes critical to speed up spatial processes, and at the same time, it reduces data volume. Reductions in data volumes can also result in secondary speed-ups, for example, less time to transfer or copy the data.\n",

    "In this recipe, we will take a boundary polygon represented by a circle Shapefile, and then remove all excess LineStrings that are outside this circle.\n",

    "<pre>\n",
    "<strong>Note </strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard function called clip performs an intersection spatial operation. This is slightly different from a normal intersection function. The clip will NOT or should not retain the attributes attached to the clip area. Clipping involves two input datasets; the first defines the boundary that we want to clip our data to, and the second defines the data that will be clipped. Both sets contain attributes and these attributes of the clipping boundary are usually not included in a clip operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new clipped data will only have the attributes from the original input dataset, excluding all the attributes from the clip polygon.\n",

    "\n",
    "To demonstrate a simple clip operation, we will take a single LineString and polygon defining a clip boundary and perform a quick intersect. The result will look like what's represented in the following screenshot and can be viewed as a live web map in your browser. Refer to the HTML file located at /code/html/ch05-01-clipping.html to check out the result.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our second result will use two Shapefiles that represent our inputs. Our real data from OpenStreetMapconverted is converted to a Shapefile format for our input and output. The circle defines our polygon area of interest, while the road LineStrings are what we want to clip. Our result will be in the form of a new Shapefile that only shows the roads that are inside the circle.\n",

    "This recipe is in two parts. The first part is a simple clip demonstration using two GeoJSON files consisting of a single LineString and polygon. The second part uses data from OSM and can be found in your /ch05/geodata folder containing the circle polygon that represents our area of interest named clip_area_3857.shp. The roads_london_3857.shp file represents our input Shapefile of lines that we will clip to the circle polygon.\n",

    "## 5.3. Finding the location of a point on a line using linear referencing\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of linear referencing is widespread, ranging from storing bus routes to oil and gas pipelines. Our ability to locate any position along a line based on a distance value from the start of the line is done using the interpolation methodology. We want to interpolate a point location at any position along a line. To determine the position, we'll use simple mathematics to calculate the position along a line based on the distance from the starting coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our calculation, we'll measure the length of the line and find a coordinate located at a specified length from the start of the line. However, the question of where the start of the line is will soon arise. The starting point of the line is the first coordinate in the LineString's array of vertexes that make up the LineString because a LineString is nothing more than a collection of points chained together.\n",

    "### How it works...\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to transform our original KML file stored in EPSG: 4326 to a planar coordinate system to facilitate our calculations (refer to the upcoming table). So, we'll begin by transforming the KML into EPSG: 27563 NTF Paris / Lambert Sud France. For further information on this, refer to http://epsg.io/27563.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we'll define three functions for our calculations starting with the pairs() function that takes a list and then uses the Python yield generator function to yield two sets of values. The first set of values is the starting x, y, and z coordinates, and the second set includes the ending x, y, and z coordinates of the coordinate pairs that we want to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calc_3d_distancte_2pts() function takes the two coordinate pairs, including the important z value, and calculates the distance between two points in 3D space using the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our readin_json() function inputs a path to a file, and in this case, we can point it to our GeoJSON file stored in the /ch05/geodata folder. This will return a Python dictionary object for us to work with within the next few steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's define the variables to hold our GeoJSON file, load this file, and set the starting 3D/2D lengths to zero for initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, let's iterate through the GeoJSON LineString features and convert them into a Shapely object so that we can use Shapely to tell us the inherent 2D length as used by our length_2d variable and read the coordinates. This is followed by our for loop where all the action occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping over our new list created by our pairs() function, we can loop over each vertex of a LineString. We define the line_start and line_end variables to identify the start of each new line segment that we need to access with a single LineString feature. We'll follow up by then defining our input parameters to do the 3D distance calculations by parsing our list object with standard Python positional slicing. At last, we'll call the calc_3d_distance_2pts() function to give us our distance in 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to iteratively sum the distances together from one segment to the next. We can do this by adding the distance to our length_3d with += operator. Now, our length_3d variable is updated for each segment in the loop, giving us our desired 3D length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining part of the loop calculates our elevation gain. Our z1 and z2 elevation values need to be constantly compared to additively add the total elevation gain only if the next value is greater than the last. If not, set them to equal each other and continue to the next z value. The elevation_gain variable is then constantly updated to itself if there's no change; otherwise not, the difference between the two elevations is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, we'll print out our results to the screen; they should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "total elevation gain is: 4322.0 meters\n",
