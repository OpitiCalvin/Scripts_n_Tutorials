    "## Installing virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe will enable you to manage different versions of different libraries for multiple projects. We use <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em> to create virtual Python environments to host collections of project-specific libraries in an isolated directory. For example, you may have an old legacy project using Django 1.4, whereas a new project requires you use Django version 1.8. With virtualenv, you can have both versions of Django installed on the same machine, and each project can access the appropriate version of Django without any conflicts or problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em>, you are forced to either upgrade the old project or find a workaround to implement the new features of the other version, therefore limiting or complicating the new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em> allows you to simply switch between different Python virtual environments for your individual projects. This has the added benefit that you can easily and quickly set up a new machine for testing or help a new developer get their machine up and running as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting ready\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anything, we are going to assume that you already have a Linux/Ubuntu machine or a virtualbox instance running Linux/Ubuntu with python3 so you can follow these instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em>, you need to have a running installation of Python and pip. The pip package manager manages and installs Python packages, making our lives easier. Throughout this book, if we need to install a package, <em style=\"color:blue;\">pip</em> will be our tool of choice for this job. The official installation instructions for pip can be found at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html. To install pip from the command line, we first need to install <em style=\"color:blue;\">easy_install</em>. Let's try it out from the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-pip</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "With this one line, you have both <em style=\"color:blue;\">pip</em> and <em style=\"color:blue;\">easy_install</em> installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<strong>NOTE:\n",
    "What is sudo?</strong>\n",
    "sudo is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user (normally, the super user or root). Its name is a concatenation of su (substitute user) and do (take action). Take a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo for more information on this.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The command sudo means to run an execution as a super user. If this fails, you will need to get the <em style=\"color:blue;\">ez_setup.py</em> file, which is available at https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py. After downloading the file, you can run it from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>$ python ez_setup.py</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now <em style=\"color:blue;\">pip</em> should be up and running and you can execute commands to complete the installations of virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. The virtualenvwrapper creates shortcuts that are faster ways to create or delete your virtual environments. You can test it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>$ pip install virtualenv</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to do it...\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to install your Python virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper packages are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install virtualenv using the pip installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <code>$ sudo pip install virtualenv</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install virtualenvwrapper using easy_install:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <code>$ sudo easy_install virtualenvwrapper</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "<strong>NOTE:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use easy_install instead of pip because with Ubuntu 14.04, the virtualenvwrapper.sh file is unfortunately not located at /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh where it should be according to the online documentation.</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign the <em style=\"color:blue;\">WORKON_HOME</em> variable to your home directory with the folder name <em style=\"color:blue;\">venvs</em>. Create a single folder where you want to store all your different Python virtual environments; in my case, the folder is located at /home/calvin/venvs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "$ export WORKON_HOME=~/venvs\n",
    "$ mkdir $WORKON_HOME\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run the source command to execute the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenvrapper.sh</em> bash file:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Next, we create a new virtual environment called <em style=\"color:blue;\">spatial</em>, and this is also the name of the new folder where the virtual environment is installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ mkvirtualenv pygeoan_cb</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "To use <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenvwrapper</em> the next time you start up your machine, we need to set it up so that your bash terminal runs the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenvwrapper.sh</em> script when your computer starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. First, put it in your <em style=\"color:blue;\">~/.bashrc</em> file:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ echo \"export WORKON_HOME=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Next, we'll import the virtualenvwrapper function in our bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>$ echo \"source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Now we can execute our bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ source ~/.bashrc </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "Step one shows how pip installs the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em> package into your system-wide Python installation. Step two shows how the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenvwrapper</em> helper package is installed with <em style=\"color:blue;\">easy_install</em> because the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenvwrapper.sh</em> file is not created using the pip installer. This will help us create, enter, and generally, work or switch between Python virtual environments with ease. Step three assigns the <em style=\"color:blue;\">WORKON_HOME</em> variable to a directory where we want to have all of our virtual environments. Then, we'll create a new directory to hold all the virtual environments. In step four, the command source is used to execute the shell script to set up the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenvwrapper</em> package. In step five, we see how to actually create a new <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em> called <em style=\"color:blue;\">spatial</em> in our /home/calvin/venvs directory. This final step automatically starts our <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em> session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em> session starts, we can now see the name of virtualenv in brackets like this:\n",
    "<code> (spatial)calvin@calvin-computer:~$ </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em>, simply type the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ deativate </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "To reactivate <em style=\"color:blue;\">virtualenv</em>, simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> $ workon spatial </code>"

    "The pyproj is a wrapper around the PROJ.4 library that works with projections and performs transformations (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj/) in Python. All your geographic information should be projected into one of the many coordinate systems supported by the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG). This information is necessary for the systems to correctly place data at the appropriate location on Earth. The geographic data can then be placed on top of each other as layers upon layers of data in order to create maps or perform analysis. The data must be correctly positioned or we won't be able to add, combine, or compare it to other data sources spatially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data comes from many sources and, often, a projection is not the same as a dataset. Even worse, the data could be delivered with a description from a data provider stating it's in projection UTM31 when, in reality, the data is in projection UTM34! This can lead to big problems later on when trying to get your data to work together as programs will throw you some ugly error messages.\n",

    "NumPy is the scientific backbone of number crunching arrays and complex numbers that are used to power several popular geospatial libraries including GDAL (geospatial abstraction library). The power of NumPy lies is in its support for large matrices, arrays, and math functions.

So, to only say that GDAL is a transformation library would be wrong; it really is so much more.
